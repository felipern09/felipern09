# üëã Hello!
I'm Felipe Rodrigues, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I‚Äôm currently making my career transition from HR manager to software developer. 
With over 9 years of experience in business field, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects and could experience how much we can achieve with technology. So I decided to work my way thru technology and start to learn witch solutions I could develop to help me and my co-workers day-to-day tasks.


# üöÄ Expertise
My primary focus is on full-stack development, although I already developed some desktop solutions too. I have started to learn Python and got experiences with data analysis, front and backend technologies and automations. As well I‚Äôm also improving my skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
I‚Äôm creative and fast learner. I love working on technology because it allows me to combine my creativity with problem-solving skills to deliver exceptional user experiences.

# üìö I‚Äôm currently working on
All my codes are still in the development phase. Although some are already in production, I am constantly learning new skills in programming and refactoring the codes. Currently, my work is focused on automations using Python modules Tkinter, Pandas, Openpyxl, PyAutogui and others. And, also, in a fullstack solution using Flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
